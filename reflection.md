I used Copilot by writing instruction comments above each function. Based on those, Copilot suggested code for load_data, clean_column_names, strip_product_and_category, handle_missing_values, and remove_invalid_rows. For column names, it used str.lower(), strip(), and replacing spaces with underscores, which matched my steps almost exactly. For handle_missing_values, Copilot suggested coercing to numeric with pd.to_numeric and then dealing with missing values.

I made several modifications, so the code matched my design and grading rubric. In clean_column_names, I added replacements for / and -. In handle_missing_values, Copilot initially leaned toward fillna(0), but I changed the rule to drop missing price or quantity to be consistent. I also ensured every function uses df = df.copy() to avoid accidental in-place edits, and I split text cleanup into its own function. 

I learned that small, consistent rules make data cleaner and easier to use. Converting price and quantity with pd to numeric with errors="coerce" is safer than manual and keeps the code readable. Dropping rows with missing or negative price/quantities leads to more accurate results. Trimming product/category text removes duplicates. I also learned that Copilot follows clear comments well, but it still needs direction. When my comments were specific, the code was close to what I needed. But it doesn’t know course rules by itself. With vague comments it suggested mixed styles. By writing precise steps and a why note, I got better drafts and only had to refine details.
